# scRNA-Seq Pipelines
Pipelines for single-cell RNA-Seq analysis

---
This repository contains pipelines for single-cell RNA-seq analysis. The pipelines mainly built on python and R programming languages. The following tools are used in the pipelines:
- Scanpy
- Seurat
- Monocle3
- Cellphonedb
- Liana
- GSEApy

We have referred to the following repositories for building the pipelines:
- [Single Cell Best Practices](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/)
- [Scanpy tutorials ](https://scanpy-singleronbio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html)


We encourage you to contribute to this repository by adding new pipelines or improving the existing ones.
